He believes it is his right to do as he pleases, even if it means disrupting the peace of others or being plain rude to them, as a king, Leo thinks everyone should look out for his well-being and comfort. One day, Leo meets a lion cub named Tooey whose mother has been recently taken away and who comes to Leo for help, being as selfish as he is, Leo turns the young lion away. However, after several different adventures, Leo learns what his place as a king is and how he must behave and treat the creatures who have almost lost all faith in him. Leo rallies the jungle animals to the rescue, and in the epilogue, the narrator Michael Donovan says that Leo asked Tooey's mother to be his queen, and the cub himself grew into a strong young lion, now called Leo II and one day he would be the Jungle King.",

In a sense it’s a meditation on personality of a love, where the personal decisions that may seem to exist at the start (archive photo, hand sewing, endoscopic closeness of the lense) are rather directed by society’s constraints, learnt family’s behavior patterns, traditional stereotypes and norms (mechanical sound, industrial rhythm, abstract visuals). In this story one could recognize her/his’s possible desires to follow the classic story of romantic love, but also feel it’s rather frequent war-like destructiveness. It is still attractive in love to believe in Moirai thread 1 driven destinies.",

The resulting re-contextualization is a perversion via production, intended to distort character perspectives. At the same time, this is an exploration of the archetypal relationship that does exist between the narrative of Back to the Future and the 9/11 terror events. The correlations uncovered are meant to indicate a conscious connective fabric that ties together all matter and energy within the universe, producing non-local phenomenon which can be referred to as synchronicity. As this fabric is observed by the characters it chronicles, their own stories will appear to reflect the fabric itself. Be cautious; there is no message here divisible from this medium.",

His unique and recently rediscovered notes allows us for the first time get a glimpse of Hermann Goering, Rudolf Hess, Hans Franck and Julius Streicher's life. The interviews deal with ever-topical questions such as: What are the psychological mechanisms underlying human evil? The film also features dramatic reconstructions of the key events of World War II.",

The biographical references to Joyce and Mando Aravantinou, combined with the diagonal slicing of the image, cancel the realism of the landscape, including that of the Narrator’s space/study. As a culmination, Joyce’s letter “A request for a loan in Greek” functions as a timely denunciation. Various routes through cities, such as Trieste, London, New York, and Athens; languages such as Greek and English. In addition to the primal myth of Ulysses, there is another issue: Greek is “the language of the subject of Ulysses”",

        "overview": "This documentary examines the social and cultural underpinnings of the trilogy of The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, in an attempt to understand the work's phenomenal success and influence. The program looks for answers in the author's sources of inspiration, from the folk legends of Norway to the field of linguistics of which Tolkien was a lifelong student. It finds that the deep chord the story strikes owes its resonance to the author's use of archetypal imagery and language. Many examples of these recurrent themes and images are given, with readings from the work and other literature. Interviews with the book's illustrators, the brothers Hildebrandt, speak to the power of the imagery in the classic story. Scholars, Tolkien's children, and the author himself provide insight into the mythic themes and the spell they have cast over the vast readership of The Lord of the Rings.",

The penniless graphic artist Walter Heck was given the job of designing the jagged, rune-like characters in 1929. The “sig” rune was rooted deep in the ideological cosmos of the Nazis and their supporters. They saw themselves as the descendants of the Teutons and declared the runes to be humanity’s original Germanic script. The symbol was meant to unite Heinrich Himmler’s “Black Order”. But did it escape their notice that it was originally of Semitic origin?  In October 1945, the Allies passed a law banning the Nazi Party and all associated organizations, including the SS. The young Federal Republic even forbade all Nazi symbols. This documentary tells the gripping story of the SS symbol, from the Middle Ages to the present day.",

And one to one, two to four, tens to hundreds, and \"one\" will be \"we\" again.  \"To dress in Latvian signs\" (\"Latvju zīmēs rotāties\") is a special and unique event in the history of Latvian stage folk dance, because instead of the usual stadium or stage format, the signs are arranged in a digital environment, merging hundreds of dancers with tradition, animations and editing possibilities. Also, what has been unprecedented in the context of stage folk dance is the sound quality with which this performance offers to listen to 15 original compositions based on folk lyrics by Mārtiņš Miļevsks.",

It was a subcultural war, the main front of which was music. It was conducted by very similar young people who did not fit into the social structure of modern Russian society.
